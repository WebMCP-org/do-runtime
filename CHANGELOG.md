# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-21

### Added

- Expose `createDurableObjectNamespace()` and its placement-channel types for standard named Durable Object bindings.
- Run Agents SDK `routeAgentRequest()`, `getAgentByName()` direct stubs, decorated callables, streaming RPC, email routing, and sub-agents through the MV3 extension host.

### Fixed

- Preserve named facet identities instead of re-hashing serialized Durable Object IDs.
- Re-enter the calling actor's input gate after outbound namespace-stub calls.
- Preserve browser WebSocket upgrade requests across PartyServer request clones.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 5f26eb1: Expose the held input lock on `ActorContainer` as `hasCurrent()` so a host stub can identify the calling actor from a lock-holding continuation and route the call through its `awaitIo`.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 5972b65: Preserve the native `ReadableStream` brand when gating response body reads so Chromium accepts tee branches as `Response` bodies.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-20

- Port workerd-style actor identity, input/output gates, SQLite KV and SQL, alarms, facets, Worker Loader, loopback exports, WebSockets, and gated host primitives to TypeScript.
- Add Node (`node:sqlite`) and browser (sqlite-wasm on OPFS) storage backends.
- Preserve rich structured-clone values and support streaming `sql.ingest()` in every lane.
- Add host-owned whole-actor snapshots for local restore and cold replica seeding.
- Run one conformance suite against pinned workerd, Node, and Chromium.
- Add real browser and MV3 Agents SDK demos, including exclusive host ownership, OPFS crash recovery, and `chrome.alarms` wake projection.
- Run Agents SDK sub-agents as same-worker browser facets, including nested children, durable schedules, and abort/delete lifecycle coverage in real MV3 Chromium.
- Type local container entry proxies as asynchronous `ActorEntry<T>` calls and centralize OPFS actor-storage lifecycle in the sqlite-wasm backend.
- Cover failed placement cleanup, clone-export safety, cross-root RPC gating, real OPFS pool exhaustion, and Agents SDK reconnect state in the browser lanes.
- Publish under FSL-1.1-MIT while preserving the Apache-2.0 terms for workerd-derived portions.
